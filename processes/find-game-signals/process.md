- `{{openai_api_key}}` — OpenAI API key
- `{{google_sheets_id}}` — target Sheet ID

---

## Output Schema (shared, consistent for both streams)

```json
{
  "signal_type": "game_announcement | studio_funding",
  "studio_name": "Rebel Wolves",
  "studio_domain": "rebelwolves.com",
  "game_title": "The Blood of the Dawnwalker",
  "funding_amount": null,
  "genre": "Action RPG",
  "platform": "PC, PS5, Xbox Series X",
  "source_url": "https://www.videogameschronicle.com/...",
  "summary": "Ex-Witcher 3 developers revealed gameplay and a September 2026 release date for their dark fantasy action RPG.",
  "date_detected": "2026-05-05"
}
```

`funding_amount` = null for game announcements.
`game_title` = null or "undisclosed" for funding rounds where game isn't named yet.

---

## Pipeline Architecture

```
STAGE 1: PARALLEL DISCOVERY (two streams, run simultaneously)
  Stream A: 6 queries → pre-release game announcements
  Stream B: 5 queries → studio funding rounds
  Tool: SerperDev /search, tbs:qdr:d, num:20
  Model: none (raw results only)

STAGE 2: DEDUPLICATE + FILTER
  Model: gpt-4o-mini
  A: filter to pre-release only, animation-heavy genres
  B: filter to actual studio funding (remove sports betting, crowdfunding <$500K)
  Dedup by game title (A) or studio name (B)

STAGE 3: ENRICH + EXTRACT
  Model: claude-haiku-4-5 (cheap, fast extraction)
  Tool: WebFetch → Spider Cloud fallback
  Extract all 8 output fields per signal

STAGE 4: WRITE TO GOOGLE SHEETS
  Append rows to master sheet, one row per signal
```

---

## Stage 1: Discovery Queries

### Stream A — Game Announcements

Run all in parallel with `tbs:qdr:d` (past 24h). Use `qdr:w` for weekly catch-up.

**A1 — Genre-gated announced (PRIMARY — best recall)**
```json
{"q": "\"action RPG\" OR \"MMORPG\" OR \"soulslike\" OR \"open world RPG\" game announced OR reveal 2026", "tbs": "qdr:d", "num": 20}
```
Validated finds: Blood of the Dawnwalker, Mortal Shell 2, Valor Mortis, Beast of Reincarnation

**A2 — VGC standalone (PRIMARY — highest precision)**
```json
{"q": "site:videogameschronicle.com announced OR reveals OR \"first look\" OR \"new game\"", "tbs": "qdr:d", "num": 20}
```
Validated finds: Blood of the Dawnwalker gameplay reveal, EA UFC 6

## Stage 2: Filter Rules

### Stream A filter
KEEP if ALL true:
1. Game is pre-release (not launched, not available now)
2. Genre is animation-heavy (see Signal Definitions above) OR publisher is major AAA (Capcom, FromSoftware, Square Enix, Ubisoft, Sony, Xbox, Bandai Namco, CD Projekt, Rockstar, Naughty Dog)
3. Not a DLC, expansion, patch, or season pass
4. Not a rumor/leak UNLESS sourced by named journalist (Tom Henderson, Jeff Grubb, etc.)

SCORE each 1-5 on AAA credibility:
- 5: First-party publisher announcement, world premiere
- 4: Named studio with animation track record, credible outlet (IGN/Eurogamer/VGC)
- 3: Confirmed game, genre match, smaller studio
- 2: Rumor with named source
- 1: Anonymous leak

### Stream B filter
KEEP if ALL true:
1. Entity raising money is a game studio or game-adjacent developer
2. Disclosed amount OR credible round type mentioned
3. NOT: sports betting (FanDuel, DraftKings, PokerStars), general entertainment M&A, government grants, crowdfunding under $500K

---

## Stage 3: Enrich and Extract

**Tool priority:** WebFetch first (free). 403/blocked → Spider Cloud fallback.

**Per signal:**
1. Scrape best source URL
2. For A4 roundup articles: extract ALL individual game titles mentioned → create one record per game
3. Extract all 8 output fields
4. Domain lookup if studio_domain missing: `{{studio_name}} official website` SerperDev search, take result #1

**Extraction prompt (claude-haiku-4-5):**
```
Extract structured data from this article. Return JSON with these exact fields:
- signal_type: "game_announcement" or "studio_funding"
- studio_name: the game development studio name (NOT the publisher)
- studio_domain: their website domain if mentioned (e.g. "rebelwolves.com")
- game_title: game title (null if studio funding with no named game)
- funding_amount: exact amount with currency (null if game announcement)
- genre: primary genre from: Action RPG, MMORPG, Soulslike, Open-World, Hack & Slash, Fighting, Third-Person Shooter, Monster Hunting, Other
- platform: comma-separated (PC, PS5, Xbox Series X, Switch, Mobile)
- source_url: this article's URL
- summary: 1-2 sentence description of what was announced

Return "not_stated" for any field not found in the article. Never fabricate.
```

---

## Stage 4: Google Sheets Output

Append each extracted record as a new row. Column order matches output schema field order:
`signal_type | studio_name | studio_domain | game_title | funding_amount | genre | platform | source_url | summary | date_detected`

Use Google Sheets API append (not overwrite). Dedup check: skip if source_url already exists in sheet.

---

## Kill List

**Stream A:**
- `site:gamesindustry.biz` for individual game reveals — returns editorial/industry analysis, not per-game news
- `site:venturebeat.com/games` as site: query — subdomain format broken in SerperDev
- Press wires (`businesswire.com`, `prnewswire.com`) for game announcements — studios use social/gaming press, not press wires for game reveals
- `"new IP"` — intellectual property law contamination (0% hit rate on LinkedIn)
- `"AA game" OR "AAA game"` on LinkedIn — returns no gaming content
- `site:reddit.com` in SerperDev — confirmed broken universally
- `"gaming company"` in press wire queries — sports betting contamination (FanDuel, DraftKings)

**Stream B:**
- `site:crunchbase.com/news` — query structure broken, 0 results
- `site:venturebeat.com/games` — subdomain broken
- GI.biz for funding — returns editorial, not deal coverage

---

## Supplementary: Reddit + LinkedIn (Trigify)

Run in parallel with SerperDev but treat as enrichment signals, not primary.

### Reddit (reddit-find CLI)

**Stream A — High-score game reveals:**
```bash
# Run stdout only (do NOT use -o flag — crashes on emoji in titles)
PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 reddit-find fetch "game reveal announced" -s Games --titles-only --max-age-days 1 --min-score 200
```
Filter: score >200 = high signal. Score 50-200 = keep if genre matches. Below 50 = skip.
Best subreddits: `r/Games`, `r/gaming` (for scores). NOT `r/gamedev` — no funding news there.

**Stream B — Studio funding (low signal, skip daily, run weekly):**
Reddit does not surface studio funding reliably. Zero results in testing. Skip for daily run.

### LinkedIn (Trigify)

**Stream A — Game announces by industry insiders:**
```bash
trigify search create \
  --name "Game Announces — Daily" \
  --keywords '["video game reveal", "game announced", "game trailer", "new title announced"]' \
  --keywords-not '["hiring", "job", "intellectual property", "IP registration", "patent"]' \
  --monitoring-type linkedin-posts \
  --time-frame past-24h \
  --frequency DAILY \
  --max-results 30 \
  --linkedin-sort-by date_posted
```
Filter results: keep only if author is Game Director / Studio Head / Creative Director / Publisher

**Stream B — Studio funding via VC posts:**
```bash
trigify search create \
  --name "Game Studio Funding — Daily" \
  --keywords '["game studio", "game developer", "gaming startup"]' \
  --keywords-and '["funding", "raised", "investment", "Series A", "seed round", "venture"]' \
  --keywords-not '["hiring", "job opening", "sports betting"]' \
  --monitoring-type linkedin-posts \
  --time-frame past-24h \
  --frequency DAILY \
  --max-results 30 \
  --linkedin-sort-by date_posted
```

## Known Failure Modes

| Failure | Cause | Mitigation |
|---------|-------|------------|
| Japanese studio announcements missed | US aggregators undercover Asia | Add `site:gematsu.com` to A3 |
| Showcase roundup returns 0 games extracted | Scraper blocked | Spider Cloud fallback on roundup articles |
| Sports betting noise in B stream | "gaming company" overloaded | Hard exclusions: -FanDuel -DraftKings in all B queries |
| Indie reveals flood Stream A | No AAA gate | Score filter: only keep AAA credibility ≥3 |
| Mobile-only funding floods B | PocketGamer skews mobile | Tag each row with platform, filter in Sheets |
| Rumor treated as announcement | Leaks look like confirms | Stage 2 filter: leaks score ≤2, confirmed ≥3 |
